# How to Add Images to the Carousel

## Quick Steps:

1. **Open the images folder:**
   - Navigate to: `public/images/` folder in your project

2. **Add your 4 images:**
   - Copy and paste your images into the `public/images/` folder
   - Name them exactly as shown below:

   ```
   public/images/
   ├── iceland-waterfall.jpg (or .png)
   ├── thailand-boat.jpg (or .png)
   ├── sydney-harbour.jpg (or .png)
   └── coastal-town.jpg (or .png)
   ```

3. **Refresh your browser:**
   - The carousel should automatically display your images

## Current Status:

✅ Carousel component is ready
✅ Images folder exists at: `public/images/`
❌ Images need to be added

## Image File Names (must match exactly):

- `iceland-waterfall.jpg` - Iceland waterfall image
- `thailand-boat.jpg` - Thailand boat image  
- `sydney-harbour.jpg` - Sydney Harbour image
- `coastal-town.jpg` - Coastal town image

## Troubleshooting:

If images still don't show:
1. Check file names match exactly (case-sensitive)
2. Check file extensions (.jpg or .png)
3. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
4. Check browser console for errors (F12)

## Note:

The carousel will show a red gradient background until you add the images. Once images are added, they will display automatically!
